Hi <%= @recording.user.first_name %>,

Your recording request for <%= @recording.datetime.strftime("%A, %B %e at %l:%M%P") %> has been confirmed. I typically start setting up about 30 minutes prior to the performance.

<% if @recording.live_stream? %>
Your performance will be streamed live at [rockwoodpro.com/live](<%= live_url %>).
<% end %>

<%= @comments %>

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kevin
