  <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>

  <p>
    CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
    websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach
    stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in
    the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites
    collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California
    consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating
    exactly the information being collected and those inpiduals or
    companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at:
    http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf<br>
  </p>

  <h2>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h2>

  <p>
    Users can visit our site anonymously.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our
    home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering
    our website.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can be easily
    be found on the page specified above.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br>
    You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>&bull;</strong> On our Privacy
    Policy Page<br>
  </p>
  <p> Can change your personal information: </p>
  <p>
    <strong>&bull;</strong> By logging in to
    your account
  </p>

  <h2>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h2>

  <p>
    We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use
    advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
  </p>

  <h2>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h2>

  <p>
    It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral
    tracking
  </p>

  <h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>

  <p>
    When it comes to the collection of personal information from children
    under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection
    Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission,
    United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule,
    which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do
    to protect children's privacy and safety online.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years
    old.
  </p>

  <h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>

  <p>
    The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy
    law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a
    significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
    globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how
    they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various
    privacy laws that protect personal information.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will
      take the following responsive action, should a data breach
      occur:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    We will notify you via email
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>&bull;</strong> Within 1 business day
  </p>
  <p>
    We also agree to the Inpidual Redress Principle which requires that
    inpiduals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against
    data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This
    principle requires not only that inpiduals have enforceable rights
    against data users, but also that inpiduals have recourse to courts
    or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance
    by data processors.
  </p>
  <h2>CAN SPAM Act</h2>
  <p>
    The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email,
    establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the
    right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out
    tough penalties for violations.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>We collect your email address in order to:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>&bull;</strong> Send
    information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>&bull;</strong> Process orders
    and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>&bull;</strong> Send you
    additional information related to your product and/or service
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the
      following:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>&bull;</strong> Not use false or
    misleading subjects or email addresses.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>&bull;</strong> Identify the
    message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.
  </p>
  <p>

    physical address of our business or site headquarters.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>&bull;</strong> Monitor
    third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>&bull;</strong> Honor
    opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>&bull;</strong> Allow users to
